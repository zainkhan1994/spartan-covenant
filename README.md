# The Spartan Covenant

An AI‑forged Spartan adventure in Meta Horizon Worlds: recover ancient Forerunner artifacts to restore fragmented memories and unravel the truth behind the galaxy’s annihilation.

## Project Overview
An AI‑forged Spartan must recover ancient Forerunner artifacts to restore fragmented memories and unravel the truth behind the galaxy’s annihilation in this epic mobile sci‑fi adventure.

## Inspiration
I’ve always been fascinated by the epic scale and mystery of **Halo’s Forerunner mythology**. When the Meta Horizon Creator Competition called for fresh, mobile‑friendly worlds, I saw an opportunity to merge two passions: Halo’s ancient‑alien lore and the cutting‑edge potential of **AI‑driven creation**.  
I was also inspired by my ongoing **Cortana project**—my ambition to build a “second‑brain” assistant that integrates every aspect of my life. This spurred me to experiment with multiple LLMs, each bringing its own strengths to the world‑building process.

## What I Learned
- **AI‑Assisted World‑Building**: By leaning on different AI assistants, I discovered how varied their creative suggestions can be:  
  - **OpenAI GPT‑4 (ChatGPT)** for narrative structure and dialogue prompts  
  - **Google Gemini** for level layout and environmental detail ideas  
  - **Anthropic Claude** for refining challenge pacing and reward feedback loops  
  - **Meta LLaMA‑based assistant** for optimizing asset count and performance tips  
- **Horizon Worlds Desktop Editor**: Building without a headset on PC is fully supported.  
- **Mobile Optimization**: Learned to balance visual fidelity with performance constraints.  
- **Rapid Prototyping Under Pressure**: Focused on core gameplay loops when time was scarce.

## How I Built It
1. **Account & Tools Setup**  
   - Joined Meta Horizon Creator Program.  
   - Installed the Horizon Worlds Desktop Editor via Meta Quest Link on Windows.  
2. **Core Concept & Design**  
   - Defined the story: AI‑forged Spartan → recover 3 Forerunner artifacts → unlock teleporter.  
   - Consulted: GPT‑4, Gemini, Claude, LLaMA assistant.  
   - Tagged the world as **Adventure**.  
3. **Environment & Props**  
   - Built a desolate Forerunner outpost: cracked landing pod, energy pillars, glowing teleporter pad.  
   - Used basic shapes + free assets for speed.  
4. **Gameplay & Scripting**  
   - Placed 3 collectible artifacts with AI‑generated TypeScript scripts to hide on touch and increment a counter.  
   - Wrote “onCollect” logic to activate the teleporter when all are gathered.  
5. **Testing & Iteration**  
   - Used Play mode to verify triggers and performance metrics.  
6. **Publishing & Demo Video**  
   - Published with **Discoverable ON**, **Members‑Only OFF**.  
   - Recorded a 3‑minute mobile walkthrough, uploaded to YouTube, and linked in Devpost.

## Challenges
- **Time Crunch**: Minimal viable experience only.  
- **No VR Headset**: Relied on desktop+mobile tests for scale.  
- **Mobile Performance**: Kept objects and scripts under Horizon’s limits.  
- **Multi‑Model Coordination**: Consolidating advice from 4 different AIs.
